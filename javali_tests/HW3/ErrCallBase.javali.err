AST Resulting From Parsing Stage:

Error message from reference is: A class type was required, but int was found
Error message: No Variable x was found

Phase semantic failed because we expected to see:
TYPE_ERROR
But we actually saw:
NO_SUCH_VARIABLE
The difference is:
At line   1 /   1:
< TYPE_ERROR
> NO_SUCH_VARIABLE

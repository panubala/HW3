AST Resulting From Parsing Stage:
ClassDecl (name: Main, superClass: Object)
| MethodDecl (argumentNames: [], argumentTypes: [], name: main, returnType: void)
| | Seq ()

| | | VarDecl (name: a, type: boolean)
| | Seq ()
Error message from reference is: Symbol 'a' was declared twice in the same scope

The difference is:
At line   1 /   1:
< DOUBLE_DECLARATION
> OK

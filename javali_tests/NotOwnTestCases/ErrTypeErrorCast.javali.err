AST Resulting From Parsing Stage:
ClassDecl (name: Main, superClass: Object)
| MethodDecl (argumentNames: [], argumentTypes: [], name: main, returnType: void)
| | Seq ()
| | | VarDecl (name: a, type: A)
| | | VarDecl (name: b, type: B)
| | Seq ()
| | | Assign ()
| | | | Var (name: a)
| | | | Cast (typeName: A)
| | | | | Var (name: b)
ClassDecl (name: A, superClass: Object)
ClassDecl (name: B, superClass: Object)
Error message from reference is: Types B and A in cast are completely unrelated.

Phase semantic failed because we expected to see:
TYPE_ERROR
But we actually saw:
OK
The difference is:
At line   1 /   1:
< TYPE_ERROR
> OK
